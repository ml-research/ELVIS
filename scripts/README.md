## Benchmark Structure
Each task in the benchmark follows this structure:
- **Categories**: Each Gestalt principle includes multiple script-based categories, each capable of generating multiple tasks.
- **Selected Task for Demonstration**: One task from each category is chosen for illustrative purposes.
- **Three positive examples**: Images that conform to the Gestalt principle.
- **Three negative examples**: Images that do not conform to the principle.
- **Explanation**: A description of the underlying logic behind the positive and negative classifications.

## Principles:
- **Proximity:** Elements that are close to each other are perceived as a group. 
- **Similarity:** Elements that look similar are perceived as part of the same group.
- **Closure:** The human mind tends to perceive complete figures even when part of the information is missing.
- **Continuity:** Elements arranged in a continuous line or curve are perceived as related.
- **Symmetry:** Elements arranged in a continuous line or curve are perceived as related.
